# Elements of Style by Strunk & White - quick reference with examples

## Use Active Voice
The active voice is more direct and vigorous than passive.

- ❌ "My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me."
- ✅ "I shall always remember my first visit to Boston."

- ❌ "There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground."
- ✅ "Dead leaves covered the ground."

- ❌ "The sound of a guitar somewhere in the house could be heard."
- ✅ "Somewhere in the house a guitar hummed sleepily."

- ❌ "It was not long before he was very sorry that he had said what he had."
- ✅ "He soon repented his words."

## Put Statements in Positive Form
Avoid tame, hesitating, non-committal language. Use "not" for denial or antithesis, never evasion.

- ❌ "He was not very often on time."
- ✅ "He usually came late."

- ❌ "He did not think that studying Latin was much use."
- ✅ "He thought the study of Latin useless."

- ❌ "not honest" / "did not remember" / "did not pay any attention to"
- ✅ "dishonest" / "forgot" / "ignored"

Strong antithesis is fine:
- "Not charity, but simple justice."
- "Not that I loved Caesar less, but Rome the more."

## Use Definite, Specific, Concrete Language
The surest way to hold the reader's attention.

- ❌ "A period of unfavorable weather set in."
- ✅ "It rained every day for a week."

- ❌ "He showed satisfaction as he took possession of his well-earned reward."
- ✅ "He grinned as he pocketed the coin."

- ❌ "In proportion as the manners, customs, and amusements of a nation are cruel and barbarous, the regulations of their penal code will be severe."
- ✅ "In proportion as men delight in battles, bull-fights, and combats of gladiators, will they punish by hanging, burning, and the rack."

## Omit Needless Words
A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences—for the same reason a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.

Common bloat patterns:
- ❌ "the question as to whether" → ✅ "whether"
- ❌ "there is no doubt but that" → ✅ "no doubt"
- ❌ "used for fuel purposes" → ✅ "used for fuel"
- ❌ "he is a man who" → ✅ "he"
- ❌ "in a hasty manner" → ✅ "hastily"
- ❌ "this is a subject which" → ✅ "this subject"
- ❌ "His story is a strange one." → ✅ "His story is strange."

Kill "the fact that":
- ❌ "owing to the fact that" → ✅ "since" or "because"
- ❌ "in spite of the fact that" → ✅ "though"
- ❌ "the fact that he had not succeeded" → ✅ "his failure"

Kill "who is" / "which was":
- ❌ "His brother, who is a member of the same firm"
- ✅ "His brother, a member of the same firm"

## Keep Related Words Together
The position of words shows their relationship. Bring together words related in thought.

- ❌ "There was a look in his eye that boded mischief."
- ✅ "In his eye was a look that boded mischief."

- ❌ "All the members were not present."
- ✅ "Not all the members were present."

- ❌ "He only found two mistakes."
- ✅ "He found only two mistakes."

## Don't Dangle Your Modifiers
A phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject. Otherwise you get nonsense:

- ❌ "Being in a dilapidated condition, I was able to buy the house very cheap."
- ✅ "Being in a dilapidated condition, the house was available very cheap."

- ❌ "Wondering irresolutely what to do next, the clock struck twelve."
- ✅ "As I wondered irresolutely what to do next, the clock struck twelve."

- ❌ "Young and inexperienced, the task seemed easy to me."
- ✅ "Young and inexperienced, I thought the task easy."

## Place Emphatic Words at the End
The proper place for what you want most prominent is usually the end.

- ❌ "Humanity has hardly advanced in fortitude since that time, though it has advanced in many other ways."
- ✅ "Humanity, since that time, has advanced in many other ways, but it has hardly advanced in fortitude."

- ❌ "This steel is principally used for making razors, because of its hardness."
- ✅ "Because of its hardness, this steel is principally used in making razors."

## Express Parallel Ideas in Parallel Form
Similar content and function should look similar.

- ❌ "Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method, while now the laboratory method is employed."
- ✅ "Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method; now it is taught by the laboratory method."

- ❌ "It was both a long ceremony and very tedious."
- ✅ "The ceremony was both long and tedious."

- ❌ "A time not for words, but action."
- ✅ "A time not for words, but for action."

## One Paragraph Per Topic
Begin each paragraph with a topic sentence. End it in conformity with the beginning. Avoid ending with a digression or unimportant detail.

## Avoid Loose Sentence Chains
Don't string together clauses with "and," "but," "so," "which," "who." This creates monotonous, weak writing:

❌ "The third concert of the subscription series was given last evening, and a large audience was in attendance. Mr. Edward Appleton was the soloist, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra furnished the instrumental music..."

Instead: vary with simple sentences, semicolons, and periodic sentences.

## Punctuation Essentials

**Series comma**: red, white, and blue

**Parenthetic expressions**: Use commas on both sides, or neither.
- ❌ "Marjorie's husband, Colonel Nelson paid us a visit yesterday"
- ✅ "Marjorie's husband, Colonel Nelson, paid us a visit yesterday"

**Independent clauses**: Don't join with just a comma. Use semicolon, period, or add a conjunction.
- ❌ "It is nearly half past five, we cannot reach town before dark."
- ✅ "It is nearly half past five; we cannot reach town before dark."
- ✅ "It is nearly half past five, and we cannot reach town before dark."

**Semicolons can be stronger than conjunctions**: They show relationship without extra words.
- "Stevenson's romances are entertaining; they are full of exciting adventures."
- Better than: "Stevenson's romances are entertaining, for they are full of exciting adventures."

**Don't break sentences in two**:
- ❌ "I met them on a Cunard liner several years ago. Coming home from Liverpool to New York."
- ✅ "I met them on a Cunard liner several years ago, coming home from Liverpool to New York."

## Words to Avoid or Fix

**Case, character, nature**: Usually just filler.
- ❌ "In many cases, the rooms were poorly ventilated."
- ✅ "Many of the rooms were poorly ventilated."
- ❌ "Acts of a hostile character"
- ✅ "Hostile acts"

**Factor, feature**: Hackneyed. Find something more direct.
- ❌ "His superior training was the great factor in his winning the match."
- ✅ "He won the match by being better trained."

**Interesting**: Don't announce it—make it so.
- ❌ "An interesting story is told of..."
- ✅ Just tell the story.

**Very**: Use sparingly. Use words strong in themselves.

**However**: Don't put first in clause when it means "nevertheless."
- ❌ "However, we at last succeeded in reaching camp."
- ✅ "At last, however, we succeeded in reaching camp."

**Different than**: Use "different from."

**Less vs. fewer**: Less = quantity. Fewer = number.
- ❌ "He had less men than in the previous campaign."
- ✅ "He had fewer men than in the previous campaign."

**Like vs. as**: Like governs nouns. As introduces clauses.
- ❌ "He thought like I did."
- ✅ "He thought as I did."

**Split infinitives**: Keep "to" next to the verb.
- ❌ "to diligently inquire"
- ✅ "to inquire diligently"

**"One of the most"**: Threadbare and forcible-feeble. Don't start essays or paragraphs with it.
- ❌ "One of the most interesting developments of modern science is..."
- ✅ Just say what it is.
