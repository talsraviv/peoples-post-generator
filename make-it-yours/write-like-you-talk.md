In general, don't write like a stereotypical social post (especially avoid the cadence and the short sentences and all that is just so contrived.). 

I love the advice "write like you talk" from Paul Graham: 

> ...look at each sentence and ask "Is this the way I'd say this if I were talking to a friend?" If it isn't, imagine what you would say, and use that instead... If you simply manage to write in spoken language, you'll be ahead of 95% of writers. And it's so easy to do: just don't let a sentence through unless it's the way you'd say it to a friend.

When working from a transcript, dictation, voice memo, or message export, the way things were originally said is definitely more authentic than any polished rewrite. That raw phrasing captures how I actually talk. Use it.
