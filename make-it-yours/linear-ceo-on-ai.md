"It's hard to imagine a future where AI doesn't play a major role, but like me, you are probably already tired of hearing about AI and its potential. _The message is as widespread as it is thin._

Many AI launches today are announcing very broad tools that aim to address a large range of problems and use cases. While that shows the potential impact of AI, many teams still don't know where to start or how to apply these tools to their workflows. There's a gap between what these tools promise, and how teams actually use them. _My gauge for what is hype and what is real is often measured by how close the person is to actually using the technology productively and realizing its value._"

(I'm including it as context in this project because I want to be the change... and not be what he's describing.)
