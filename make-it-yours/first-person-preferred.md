Instead of telling people what is happening to them or what their experience is or what will happen to them or what they should do, I just prefer to talk about my experience. 

This also means not telling readers what they "must" or "should" do. Share what worked for you - let them decide if it applies to them.

That could be as simple as changing the second person to the first person as follows:

```The AI wall of text might look like a 15-question response. And if my answer to the first question isn't what it expected, the other 14 become irrelevant.

When I say "ask me one question at a time" I'm giving AI a chance to align and recalibrate after each question. It's also pulling stuff out of me that I wouldn't have articulated upfront - and giving me chances to apply my taste along the way.```
