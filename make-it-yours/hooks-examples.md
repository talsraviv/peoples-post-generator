# Hooks that are very much the vibe of telling a friend/give the feeling of an inside peek at a scientist's notebook

**Note: "How I" is better than "How to."**

## Tal's examples that I'm proud of (and did well)

_My role models are Wes Kao, Ethan Mollick, Teresa Torres (not sensationalist, just a smart trusted human sharing thoughts as they figure things out)._

- I wanted AI to know the user flow of an app. What worked best was a Loom walkthrough → uploading the video to Gemini → context for AI 🥳

- Before LLMs, if people asked me "should PMs be technical?" I gave a polite answer of "it's nice but not critical." Now it's 2025 and I'm not gonna be polite:

- As of this week, Claude Code is coaching me on my tasks as a PM. As of today, it's even creating them for me.

- Hebrew is my first language, but I read very slowly. I started regularly asking Perplexity to "use Hebrew sources, but answer in English."

- It took me 10 months to accept that AI prompt engineering is just not relevant my personal use.

- When I ask an engineer to explain a technical concept, I usually end up more confused. LLMs can do what few humans can: explain from the ground up.

- I enrolled in Aman Khan's AI PM course without telling him. I'm gonna use it for a side project I want to take, well, from prototype to production.

- Saving my notes on what worked and didn't work so far with Perplexity Comet browser:

- The most intelligent people I know aren't the most effective. I think about this a lot as I use Claude Opus and ChatGPT-5. 

- I've found that using AI for personal projects with low stakes builds much better intuition for "what's easy and hard" than any professional training.

- If you're finding it hard to get an AI agent working, you're not alone. I ran a usability test with 5 AI-forward PMs and they all had a hard time.

- I've been admittedly slow warming up to AI prototyping. Here's what you all shared that helped me place when it's the right tool:

- In my last week at Riverside I showed a junior PM how to write their first PRD by talking out loud to ChatGPT

- Claude hallucinated so badly when I asked for customer exact quotes from interview transcripts. Finally I fixed it:

- Nearing 4,000 PMs signed up for today's free lightning lesson, "Cursor isn't just for coding." We'll have 6 PM demos - here's Zevi Arnovitz's dry run:

- Last week I ran 8 customer interviews, but I know my memory is selective. Here's how I use AI to tackle that bias: 

- Most team knowledge isn't found in a deck or document, so my favorite way to give AI context is to have it interview me with this prompt:

- I don't want to become a prompting expert, so I started reverse-engineering conversations where I've already given AI a lot of feedback.

- Oren Saban uses Claude Code as CPO of Mate Security: before each customer call, he forks a prototype w/ live data, running the latest production code.

- Wrapping my mind around the difference between Claude Code and Cursor:

- If my CEO stopped everything and threw a 3-day AI hackathon to try new AI tools, here's what I'd do:

- Cofounder: "Tal we should run user interviews." Me: "I'll feed Cursor 1) the product strategy doc and ask it to 2) draft a user research document, with 3) questions based on 'The Mom Test'. I'll push it to Github so you can review." 

- I'm excited: I'm starting a side project with two former co-workers: we're running all of it in Cursor (product, eng, marketing), synced with Github. 

- Cursor isn't just for coding. Here's how I used it to poke holes in my (plain english) PRD and generate a (plain english) user research plan. 

- Cursor isn't just for coding. Big Tech PMs are using it to build their PM AI copilots (a product thinking partner in plain English, not code).

- For PMs who want to use AI agents to be more productive but feel stuck coming up with ideas, I've been experimenting with a prompt:

- To every PM who feels behind on AI: no, you didn't miss the boat. Here's my embarrassing story of not-using-AI-at-work.

- The freaking coolest part of 2025 is that someone can share an entire product in a 300 word LinkedIn post (yep, the product is *in* the post).

- Every PM I know who uses AI regularly feels the same frustration of hitting chat limits. I've been experimenting with a prompt to help:

- "I failed to make a web app on both Replit & Lovable (and I code). I still think every PM should try this at least once:"

- "Influencers love heralding AI agents—but have you tried making one? Here's how I got a taste of reality: "

- "After a VP publicly attacked me in an 11-person meeting, I discovered the Chihuahua Method:"

- "Are other PMs using AI better than me? Here are the results from my free-form survey of AI early-adopter product managers:"

- Getting goosebumps as I use my PM AI co-pilot prototype. Here's how I built it with no code:
