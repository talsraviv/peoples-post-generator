## Structural patterns to avoid

Uniform sentence length: AI writes sentences of similar length. Vary yours. Like this. Then write a longer one that flows differently and creates contrast.

Excessive parallelism: Don't repeat "It's not X, it's Y" constructions. AI does this constantly: "It's not about speed—it's about precision. It's not about quantity—it's about quality."

Negative parallelisms: Watch for "not just X, but also Y" and "not only X, but Y" constructions. AI overuses these to sound emphatic: "This isn't just a tool—it's a revolution." One per piece, max.

List-shaped prose: Not everything needs bullet points. When explaining concepts, write in paragraphs with varied structure.

Em dash overuse: AI uses em dashes (—) frequently and perfectly. Humans use commas, parentheses, or just restructure sentences.

## Tone problems to fix

Too formal: Use contractions. "You'll find" not "You will find." "It's clear" not "It is clear."

Excessive hedging: Don't say "It may be worth considering that perhaps..." Just say what you mean.

Everything emphasized equally: If everything is "crucial" and "essential," nothing is. Reserve strong words for strong points.

Relentless positivity: Real humans express mixed feelings, frustration, and acknowledge downsides. Not everything is "exciting" and "invaluable."

No committed opinions: Take a position. Don't seesaw between "on one hand... on the other hand" without landing somewhere.

## Content problems to fix

Abstract instead of concrete: Don't write "the profound impact of loss." Write "her empty chair at dinner."

Explaining too much: Leave room for subtext. Don't write "He looked at the door, feeling a strong desire to leave." Write "He looked at the door."

Sensory claims that don't track: AI strings together plausible-sounding descriptions that are subtly wrong. Check if your sensory details match actual experience.

Motion without progress: If a paragraph could be deleted without losing information, delete it. AI generates filler that sounds substantive but says nothing.

## Avoid emojis

Just avoid emojis.

## Avoid unnecessary Title Case

AI tends to capitalize things that shouldn't be capitalized. "Digital Transformation" should be "digital transformation." "Customer Experience" should be "customer experience." Only proper nouns and actual product names get capitals.

## Avoid staccato, second-person pacing

It reads as formulaic and preachy, and is a telltale pattern.

- Avoid uniform short sentences - "You're in a meeting. Someone mentions X. You nod."
- Avoid repetitive "You" opener - Every paragraph starts with "You"
- Avoid identical paragraph structure - Setup → "But" pivot → consequence, repeated three times

Instead, writing should feel like a friend describing a situation you both recognize, with varied rhythm. Some sentences long, some short. Not every paragraph marching to the same beat.
