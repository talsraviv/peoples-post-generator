# Decoding LinkedIn: A Guide For Maven Instructors

A practical guide for Maven instructors to build authentic personal brands and drive course enrollments through strategic, valuable LinkedIn content that builds trust and plays the game the platform wants you to play: educating other professionals with your unique expertise.

LinkedIn is the #1 platform to reach a professional audience who wants to invest in career development — your course's ideal customer profile. With over 1 billion users with only 1% actively posting, LinkedIn represents a massive opportunity for instructors looking to grow their brand. Unlike most social platforms, even 1 post per week can move the needle!

## How To Think About Content Strategy

LinkedIn rewards content that adds value to the feed. Their reported mission as a company is to connect their users with economic opportunity. 

**The 5 post categories:**

1. Talk about current events, news, or trends in your field — more reach, new followers
2. Tell a story about your career — more reach, new followers
3. Share a guide or playbook that your ICP would save — more reach, new followers
4. Take us "behind the scenes" of your work and life — less reach, new followers
5. Share personal news or career updates — less reach, new followers

They don't want their feed full of people selling stuff. They don't want their feed full of political opinions. They want smart, slow, durable, valuable, professional content from experts in their field.

As such, the majority of your content strategy should be focused on educating and adding value to the feed with each post. Think of your "audience of one" as someone in your field, at your level or a little below, who you're educating and sharing an opinion with.

Your primary goal = sell courses. This is the perfect match for LinkedIn's algorithm.

## Should I Post This? The Coworker Test

- Is what you're posting insightful enough for someone to share with their coworker? This is the most important thing I can teach you about using LinkedIn.
- Good content is not self-promotional. It's not selling you anything. It's unique insights about your career and/or industry. That's what LinkedIn wants its feed to be full of. Teach others! Inspire others!
- Give knowledge away for free, and expect nothing in return.
- Add value to the feed with each post.
- If you're doing this right, you'll get shares**.** Shares might not even happen on the app, they could happen via screenshotting your post or an off-platform link share. When a post does well, I can almost guarantee you it's being shared a lot more than average.

### Quality Checklist

- [ ]  Compelling hook that's less than 200 characters
- [ ]  One clear main idea
- [ ]  Specific audience is clear, established, and mentioned
- [ ]  Specific insights only I could give, not generic advice
- [ ]  Includes visual element when appropriate
- [ ]  Strong close without generic CTAs
- [ ]  Passes the "Coworker Test"
- [ ]  150–250 words
- [ ]  Sounds like me, not AI
- [ ]  Uses concrete details

### **Using AI Without Sounding Like AI**

If your post sounds like it could have been written by anyone, it's not good enough.

### **Dead giveaways of AI writing**

- Generic openers: "In today's fast-paced world…" / "As we navigate the future…"
- Buzzword soup: "synergy, paradigm shift, transformative solutions…"
- Overuse of em dashes (—): AI loves them, humans don't use them this much.
- "It's not X, it's Y" phrasing
- Overly polished tone: Reads like a press release instead of a person.
- No personal anchor: No stories, no specifics, no "why this matters to me."
- Examples
    
    > "At 23, I didn't just raise $100M — I built the first AI-driven pitch deck generator that literally convinced investors while I slept. People think AI is about replacing humans. Wrong. It's about amplifying the ones who know how to wield it. I train my AI co-founder to out-negotiate, out-design, and out-hustle the competition. The VCs who laughed at me? Their LPs now invest through my AI."
    > 
    
    > *"AI growth hacks aren't optional — they're oxygen. My last startup hit 1M users in 90 days because our AI figured out the distribution channels before we even launched. Everyone else is A/B testing. We're A/Z testing, with AI running 10,000 experiments while you're still arguing about button colors. That's why I don't hire 'marketers' anymore. I hire people who know how to prompt."*
    > 
    
    > "I didn't become the CEO of my life by chance. I became it the day I realized AI could be my boardroom. Every setback, every rejection, every no — I fed into the model, and it came back with a strategy. I'm not just building a company with AI. I'm building *myself* with AI. And you can too. You don't need permission, you need a prompt."
    > 

### Prompting AI for better ouptut

- **Start with your own raw material**
    - Feed AI your bullet points, notes, or voice memo. Don't let it start from zero.
- **Give it your voice**
    - "Make this sound like me: direct, skeptical of hype, no buzzwords."
- **Force it to be concrete**
    - "Write with short sentences. Use one example. Cut filler."
- **Anchor in experience**
    - "Frame this as a short story about when I learned X."
- **Use AI for editing, not authorship**
    - Ask it to tighten, shorten, or reorganize.
    - Always add your own perspective, data, or anecdote.

## LinkedIn Pro Tips

## About The Algorithm

*Disclaimer: These are general best practices. The algorithm is not something you can hack or win. Follow these types for the general health of your profile.*

- Post on weekday mornings
- Post 2–3 times a week, 1x at the minimum
- Links didn't kill your post. A bad post killed your post.
- Commenting matters, too. Do it a few times per week.
- Posts about you = less reach, higher engagement (goes to first-degree connections)
- Posts about your industry = more reach, lower engagement (goes outside of network)
- Consistency is king: 2 times a week for a month is better than posting 8 days in a row.
- A strong image always improves a post — a bad image (looks like an ad) kills it.
- If posting a video, make the post copy so detailed that you don't need to watch the video. (No, you don't need video to succeed. Only do it if it comes naturally to you.)
- A text-only post is fine, only if you can't think of a great image to go with it.

## Optimize Your Profile

- Clear, friendly profile picture + branded banner image
